IdentityMatcher
===============

This is a Rails plugin that adds the ability to import social networks from sites such as Twitter and Gmail. Put it in your vendor/plugins directory. 


Example
=======

Add this line to your app's User model:

matches_identities

and your user model will gain the following methods:

User.match_gmail(username, password)
User.match_gmail_api(authsub_token)
User.match_twitter(nick)
User.match_hcard(url)
etc...

The return value is a two-element list. The first element is a list of User objects that match the identities found in the external source. The second element, if available for that mode of matching, is a list of found external identities that weren't matched, giving their name and email address in a hash.

Restrictions
============

The code assumes that your user model uses the field 'email' for email address and 'nick' for screen name. A future version will parameterise this.
